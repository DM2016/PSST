Description: Given a directory with Magic-BLAST output files where each output file
             contains the alignment between an SRA dataset and known variants in a human
             genome, this script determines which variants each SRA dataset contains
             using a heuristic.
Usage: call_variants.py
[-h (help and usage)]
[-m <directory containing .mbo files>]
[-v <path to variant info file>]
[-f <path to the reference FASTA file>]
[-o <output path for TSV file>]
[-t <unit tests>]
